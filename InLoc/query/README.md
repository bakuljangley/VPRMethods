# InLoc dataset

Our InLoc dataset [2] contains color RGB images taken by iphone7 from different locations, times from original WUSTL RGBD [1], and 6DoF reference poses which are manually verified and able to be used for evaluating visual localization methods. 
We also provide color RGB perspective images and depth maps which are generated from RGBD scans originally provided by [1] and used as the database for InLoc dataset in our paper. 

This repository provides the tools for constructing the whole of InLoc datset in the proper format to be easily used by [our InLoc demo and evaluation toolkit](https://github.com/HajimeTaira/InLoc_demo). 

## Usage

1. Download transformation matrices from <http://cvpr17.wijmans.xyz/> in the zip format. Put all zip files to ``database/alignments/zips/``. 

2. Download and extract all database files: Run ``./extract_db_all.sh`` in the terminal. 

3. Download and extract query images: Run ``extract_query.sh`` in the terminal. 

## Structure

**database/scans**

Each folder corresponds to the building floor. In each folder, there are 3D scan datas originally provided in [1] converted in matlab binary format. 

`cse_scan_000.ptx.mat` : the 3D points converted in matlab file. 

**database/alignments**

Each file, e.g. cse_trans_000.txt, contains transformation matrix that converts 3D points in original ptx file to global coordinates. 
Please see more details at [1]. 

**database/cutouts**

The subfolder, e.g. `database/cutouts/CSE3/000`, corresponds to the ptx file `database/scans/CSE3/cse_scan_000.ptx.mat`. 
In each subfolder, there are 36 perspective images and 

`cse_cutout_000_0_-30.jpg`: RGB perspective image

`cse_cutout_000_0_-30.jpg.mat`: RGB perspective image (RGBcut) and the scan points (XYZcut) seen from this perspective view. 

**query/iphone7**

Query images taken by iphone7.
